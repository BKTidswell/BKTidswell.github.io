 		<h2>Oxidative Stress Genes in Diatoms</h2>
 		<div class="para">
	 		<p>	The purpose of our project was to learn more about the upstream 
	 			regions of oxidative stress related genes in diatoms. Diatoms produce 
	 			 reactive oxygen species which are useful in small amounts but in high levels can 
	 			 damage DNA, proteins, and lipids. Our project focused on three specific promoter 
	 			 types, the TATA box, the GC box, and the CAT box. We BLASTed the genomes against
	 			 known oxidative stress genes in mice and plants, and then located them in the
	 			 diatom genomes. I provided the coding expertise for this project. We found
	 			 that the two model species 
	 			 of diatom shared a larger percentage of oxidative stress related genes 
	 			 than they did other genes, but we did not find any consistant trends in
	 			 their upstream regions.
