 		<h2>Neural Network Evolution</h2>
 		<div class="para">
	 		<p>&nbspFor my final project in my neural modeling class I created an evolutionary
	 			 neural network population. The goal of this project was to determine whether
	 			 changing the task they had to solve increased modualrity in a popualtion.
	 			 Neural networks were randomly created for the initial population. They were 
	 			 evaluated on their ability to solve the XOR problem. Based on how well they
	 			 managed to approximate XOR they then had offspring. In the experimental groups
	 			 the task was switched from XOR to NOT-XOR a number of times. While populations
	 			 were able to re-optimize to the new task after the switch there was no increase
	 			 in modualrity seen with more switches between XOR and NOT-XOR.
