	 		<p>	At Vassar College I am working on a
	 			cognitive science research project with a team
	 			of three students and three profesors. Our 
	 			hypothesis is that gene duplication increases modularity of the networks,
	 			and modular networks give advantages to agents, improving the evolvability
	 			of the population. We created artificial genomes that 
	 			dictate their our robotics agents neural networks. We created an arena 
	 			with lights and walls, and reward the robots with increased fitness if they 
	 			are able to find areas with lots of light away from the walls, or in darkness
	 			close to the walls. Through reproduction and mutation we expect later agents
	 			to be be able to better perform the task we designed for it. This research 
	 			project is still ongoing.
