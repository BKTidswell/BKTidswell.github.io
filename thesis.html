 		<h2>Modeling Altruism</h2>
 		<div class="para">
	 		<p>	The purpose of my thesis is to delve into the evolutionary basis
	 			of altruism. I am focusing on the three main theories as to the 
	 			evolution of altrusim: kin, group, and reciprocal
	 			selection. There are models that explore these theories, but
	 			there is not an agent based model that compares all of them within
	 			the same game. In order to create this comprehensive model I will
	 			evolve agents under three different game conditions: gift-giving,
	 			public goods, and iterated prisonerâ€™s dilemma. These game models
	 			will use the same high-level definitions of these theories and
	 			the same reproductive rules and fitness functions. Thus 
	 			I will be able to do within and between game comparisons with the 
	 			model I plan to build. You can find the code on my Github.
