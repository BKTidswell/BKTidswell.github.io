Working with Anthony Scibelli and Cassandra Donatelli I helped to create MONOLITh, a bioinspired, untethered crawling soft robot. Its body is made of a lightweight reticulated foam, and it uses DC motors that pull on internal Kevlar tendons to move. With its caterpillar-based design and differential friction elements allowing it to grip surfaces, MONOLITh is able to move by inching, compression, or rolling. For my part in this project, I wrote the code that controlled the robot, and helped to design and test the final product. MONOLITh was presented at both RoboSoft 2019 and AMAM 2019.
