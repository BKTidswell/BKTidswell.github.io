I am a 6th year PhD Candidate in at Biology Department at Tufts University in the Lab of [Dr. Eric Tytell](https://as.tufts.edu/biology/people/faculty/eric-d-tytell). My research focuses on fish school as I work to understand the ways that fish school without vision or their lateral line. I have abroad interest in animal movement and social behaviors.
