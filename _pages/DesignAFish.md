Working with the Museum of Science here in Boston, my lab developed an educational experience to teach visitors about fish locomotion, and how different body shapes and sizes affect that locomotion. This interactive Design-A-Fish exhibit introduced fish swimming, engineering, and robotics to visitors, allowing them to make their own fish bodies, and try to place in the top ten on the daily scoreboard. 

For this project I wrote the code that ran the robotic car which tested the fish bodies, as well as the GUI that controlled the scoreboard and car.
