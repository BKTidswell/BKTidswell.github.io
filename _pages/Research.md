## Fish Schooling

Fish and other organisms move together in coordinated groups to defend against predators, give them allies to help gather food, and lessen the metabolic costs of transportation. Whether they are in a herd, flock, or school, animals form and maintain their groupings using multiple sensory modalities. In the lab, animal groups are often studied in well-lit, open environments, when their senses receive good information. But in the natural environment, sensing is often limited. For example, fish school in darkness, flow, or with damaged lateral lines, conditions that limit the information they can gain from their senses. 

My research investigates how the school structure of giant danios (*Devario aequipinnatus*) changes in conditions that limit sensory information. The goal of this work is to understand how fish adjust their schooling behavior in order to adapt to information-poor situations. I place giant danios in flow, darkness, or ablate their lateral lines. This allows me to see how these conditions effect the syntonization, polarization, and density of the schools.

I use [DeepLabCut](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) to track the fish, allowing me to quickly and easily get the midlines of the fish from the high speed videos taken while they are in the flow tank. 

## Fish Education

Working with the Museum of Science here in Boston, my lab developed an educational experience to teach visitors about fish locomotion, and how different body shapes and sizes affect that locomotion. This interactive Design-A-Fish exhibit introduced fish swimming, engineering, and robotics to visitors, allowing them to make their own fish bodies, and try to place in the top ten on the daily scoreboard. 

For this project I wrote the code that ran the robotic car which tested the fish bodies, as well as the GUI that controlled the scoreboard and car. 

## Soft Robotics

Working with Anthony Scibelli and Cassandra Donatelli I helped to create MONOLITh, a bioinspired, untethered crawling soft robot. Its body is made of a lightweight reticulated foam, and it uses DC motors that pull on internal Kevlar tendons to move. With its caterpillar-based design and differential friction elements allowing it to grip surfaces, MONOLITh is able to move by inching, compression, or rolling. For my part in this project, I wrote the code that controlled the robot, and helped to design and test the final product. MONOLITh was presented at both RoboSoft 2019 and AMAM 2019.
